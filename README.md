# btMatrix

An [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc) sketch for the [Feather M0 Bluefruit LE](https://learn.adafruit.com/adafruit-feather-m0-bluefruit-le). The sketch provides the ability to recieve a phrase via Bluetooth that can then be displayed on  Neopixel based Matrices. The code in the sketch was based on the Adafruit Gugenhat example code, but has gone through a number of changes to suit our purposes.
